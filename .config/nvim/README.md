# NeoVim
The neovim config of me, inspired (and heavily copied from ThePrimaGen)

## Roadmap
- [ ] shift tab and like (example use V and < or > to indent)
- [ ] TODOS
- [ ] pick and choose from https://github.com/xoac/nvim
- [ ] file tree
- [ ] terminal integration (at least learning to use it)
- [ ] side panel scratch buffer to which stdout gets outputted of a script/program
- [ ] status line?
